## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *   - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *     Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

In a world where technology is slowly replacing a lot of face-to-face interaction, 
people are finding it more difficult to meet new people. A study conducted by OnePoll 
in 2019 found that 45% of adults in the United States find it difficult to make new friends, 
and the average adult has not made a new friend in the past five years. So if practically 
half of adults are struggling to meet new people, there has to be a better way for 
them to know who else is feeling the same way.

Our design aims to solve this issue through the interaction of a physical pin/name 
tag and a mobile app. The pin is a low powered E-ink display used to simplify the 
process of adding new friends on the app and let others know they are part of the 
PinPals community. The mobile app allows people to schedule/find activities to do 
with new people and also aid in the process of finding other people who are looking 
for friends.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

The main focus of our design research was gaining a better understanding for what makes 
different social situations easier or more difficult to meet new people. We conducted 
four interviews asking each participant to talk about a time where they felt most 
comfortable meeting new people and another time where they felt least comfortable. Each 
of our four participants were young adults who have recently moved or have moved around 
a lot in their lives. The first interview was with Tom Honda, a Ramp Agent at Sea-Tac 
and has recently moved here from California. The second interview was with John Thundergun, 
a marketing associate for a technology company who travels around a lot and moved to Seattle 
about a year ago. The third interview was with Frank Reynolds, a military veteran who has 
recently moved to Seattle. And the final interview was with James Johnson, who recently moved 
to the Seattle area from India. We decided to choose these participants for our research 
because we figured people who have just moved would have the most recent experience meeting 
new people.

### It's difficult when people are part of an out-group trying to join an in-group

Several of our participants mentioned that it was difficult and was very uncomfortable to 
meet new people when they felt as though they were in an out-group trying to become part 
of an in-group. Tom stated during the interview that he has a better time connecting with 
other people not from Seattle due to them both being part of the out-group in a way. It is 
difficult moving to a new place where everyone already has their group and so it is easier 
to just meet other people in a similar situation. John also stated that he found it much 
easier to meet new people at events when nobody has started to form groups yet, however 
as soon as people became grouped up, if he was not in a group it was much more difficult 
to then join a group.

### The Environment can play a key role in meeting other people

The environment that social interaction also played a large roll in how easy it 
was for our participants to meet new people. John expressed during the interview 
that he was much more comfortable meeting people in quieter settings compared to 
loud, more stressful environments. Frank also stated that it is more difficult for 
him to meet new people in large crowded settings. And James mentioned that he 
has found that people are not as open to talking outside, especially if the 
weather is bad. All of these comments revolve around the idea of there being 
envornemnts that are better fitted for these kinds of interactions. From our 
research it seemed like quiter, less hectic environments with smaller groups were 
better for meeting new people.


### It is difficult to know what people's intentions are when first meeting

Another aspect of meeting new people that surfaced during our interview process was 
the intentions behind the two people meeting each other. It is difficult to meet 
people a lot of times because it is not always clear what the other person's intentions 
are and interactions can go poorly if the intentions do not match. John talked about 
how he was in a book store once and was approached by a woman and had a nice conversation 
with her for a while before realizing that she was ultimately trying to recruit him for 
a pyramid scheme she was apart of. Frank also mentioned how he wouldn't try to talk to a 
female at the gym because it would be assumed he was just trying to hit on them. It is 
difficult to know what people's intentions are when first meeting and this can have a very 
negative impact on how first interactions go.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: storyboardImage,
        },
        {
            src: initialPaperPrototype,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Here is our storyboard and initial paper prototype"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

First, a Paper Prototype was built to test the accomplishment of two main tasks: finding 
activities to do nearby and finding people nearby. The paper prototype allows for rapid 
iteration while encouraging feedback at the appropriate level of idea maturity required 
by this phase. Next, the paper prototype was given a heuristic evaluation to determine 
easily identifiable errors and oversights. These improvements were added to the prototype. 
Then, the revised paper prototype was tested using three different participants, who were 
asked to test the two main tasks. The two main tasks were tested by evaluating four 
subtasks: scan a pin and add a friend, locate and register for an event, find and message 
a nearby person, and edit their profile. From these evaluations, we have concluded three 
main errors.

### Misleading Icons

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: misleadingIconImageDM,
        },
        {
            src: misleadingIconImageMap,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

An improved design favors recognition over recall. Therefore, it is important to identify 
design choices that require the participant to remember what an icon is meant to represent. 
One of our most frequently commented symbols was the map. The participant, John Smith, said, 
"I know I should click on something that looks like a map, and this looks most like a map, 
so I assume this is it." Therefore, in the paper prototype, the map symbol had details added 
to indicate better what it was meant to represent.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Logistical Issues

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: logisticalIssueDMs,
    }}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Some oversights can be a showstopper when implemented on a final design but may be easily overlooked 
in the iterative design process. During one of the useability tests, the participant began sending a 
message to another app member when they noted there was no "send" button after they typed their message. 
Commonly, this button does not appear until a message is available to be sent. However, the original 
design did not allow a message to be delivered. The new send button was added to the design, and further 
testing was performed.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Design Bias


<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: designBiasLevles,
    }}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Choosing a design is a careful process, but often some factors may be overlooked. Although the design team 
may have reached a consensus, useability testing may identify when a choice can make people uncomfortable. 
Originally, the profile page indicated a metric, experience/level, that indicated to others how many 
interactions you have had with others. This was expected to be a good indicator of how likely someone was to 
be good at providing a positive experience to others who meet them as well. During one usability test, the 
participant said, "what is this experience thing? I feel I'd be less likely to use this because someone will 
notice my low level." Because social anxiety is a grave factor that prevents people from meeting strangers, 
it was decided to remove this information from the visible portions of the PinPals system.

## Resulting Design

The main features of our resulting design will enable people to:

1. Create events based on certain activities so other people who are interested can join.
2. Search for other people via a map feature that shows nearby people. This is also shown in a list 
representation of all nearby people.
3. Search for events via a map feature that shows nearby events. This is also shown in a list 
representation of all nearby people.
4. Message other people/event groups
5. Customize their profile, through changing badges, as well as other information.
6. Create customizable pins to wear outside. Scanning another people's pin's QR code 
will let you see their profile and DM them in the app.

You can see our resulting design from the images below that will walk you through how our app works on how to 
complete the 2 main tasks we have. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: homeScreenImage,
        },
        {
            src: mapScreenImage,
        },
        {
            src: mapListEventsImage,
        },
        {
            src: concertEventPinImage,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

### Task 1: Find activities around you that you enjoy doing with others

Upon opening the app, you will be taken to the home page. From the home page, click the map button on the 
bottom navigation bar. Now, from the map screen, you can look for events on the map by scrolling around 
you. These event icons are represented by a green and white diamond. Alternatively, you can select the 
list icon right under the search bar to view all nearby events in a list format. In both list and map 
formats, you can click on an event that interests you and view more information about that event, such 
as directions, time, location, and more. If interested, you can then register!

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: homeScreenImage,
        },
        {
            src: mapScreenImage,
        },
        {
            src: mapListPeopleImage,
        },
        {
            src: popUpScreenImage,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

### Task 2: Find people around you that are willing to meet new people

Upon opening the app, you will be taken to the home page. From the home page, click the map button on 
the bottom navigation bar. Now, from the map screen, you can look for other people on the map by 
scrolling around you. These orange white icons represent people around you. 
Alternatively, you can select the list icon right under the search bar to view all nearby people in a 
list format. In both list and map formats, you can click on a name that interests you and view more 
information about that person by going into their profile. Clicking on someones icon also allows you to 
message them, which will allow you to form a new friend! 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: profileScreenImage,
        },
        {
            src: dmsScreenImage,
        },
        {
            src: messageScreenImage,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

### Other Key Features: You are able to customize your own profile, as well as communicate with other people/event groups!

This is an example of what your profile would look like. You can include details about yourself, 
a bio, prompts to answer, as well as badges to show what kind of activities you are into. Clicking on 
the messaging icon in the top right of the screen will bring you to your messages. You can filter 
between other people and event groups to select one and communicate!

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: tagAcornImage,
        },
        {
            src: tagDinoImage,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        ""
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

### Pin Feature: Here are a couple examples of what the customizable pin you could wear looks like!
You can change the badges, color, and shape of the pin!

This pin would be something that you could clip onto your backpack or suitcase while traveling as well 
as wear like a nametag at a networking event. This lets everyone know that you are part of the PinPal 
community so people who are also in the community know you appraochable as well as being a good 
conversation starter for people who are not in the community! After you meet someone, just have them scan 
your QR code on their app and this will add you as friends.
