The evergrowing clothes industry has detrimental effects on our planet both in 
creating clothing and disposing unworn items. It has more greenhouse gas emissions 
than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. Additionally, every year, 
the average American throws away 81.5 lbs of clothes. Globally, 92 million tonnes
of clothing waste end up in landfills per year. It takes a toll on the environment
to favor the acquistion of new items while neglecting what we already own.

That's where Green Closet comes in. Green Closet allows participants to keep track of
what they are wearing and how often they are wearing it. In turn, participants
can identify their most and least used items in their closet and either change
their outfits or give away what they no longer need. In doing so, Green Closet
helps people to ensure they do not own or acquire clothes they won't wear and 
encourage recyling and thrifting over buying new items.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

When designing our solution, we wanted chose to focus on three main things for our research
phase: problems, reasons, and possible solution motivations. That is, identifying issues and
their reasons and possible ways we could motivate people to fix these issues.

People have different reasons and motivations behind their actions and that includes those
pertaining to their closet. For example, a shirt may be unworn because it's forgotten or because
it's hard to outfit plan around. Similarly, how we then attempt to solve the issue needs to
match the motivation of our targeted user group (fashion, environment, money, etc.) or else 
we risk creating a solution nobody wants.

For our design research, we chose to do a survey followed by interviews because the survey 
allowed us to poll a large number of people with minimal effort and narrow down our problem 
space. In our survey, we asked them multiple choice questions like how much of their closet they used and
how much they valued sustainability on a scale of 1 to 5. From there, we were able to decide 
what questions and areas to investiage more during our interviews. For example, we explored 
the exact reasons behind why people tended to neglect certain items and their daily routine 
when choosing an outfit for the day.

We chose to focus on UW students since they are easily accessible. Additionally, young adults 
are more likely to engage in fast fashion, thrifting, and exchanging clothes via an app so 
they would be able to take advantage or be in need of our app's services.

### Most people do not use their entire closets

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: researchClosetUsed,
    }}
    caption={
        "How much of their closets do people report wearing?"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

As we buy and receive clothes, they easily pile up in our closets never to be seen again. During our research,
we wanted to find out how widespread and severe this problem was with our participants.
From our survey, 87.5% of participants estimated that they use 80% or less of their closet 
on a day-to-day basis. In our interviews, all participants estimated at or below 70% use. These results
show us that the problem is very common and significantly severe enough to address.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### People neglect certain clothing items for different reasons

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: burstingCloset,
    }}
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In our survey, outside of niche and seasonal clothing, people most often cited forgetting the item exists
(45.1%) and having difficulty outfit planning with it (44.4%). Less common but still significant, 15.3% said
they couldn't find the article of clothing and 16% claimed they had too many clothes and simply couldn't
wear them all.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Many people cannot implement sustainability to the extent they would like

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: researchSustainability,
    }}
    caption={
        "Clothing stores in UVillage (none of which are thrift stores)"
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In a world in which it's increasingly becoming more important to be sustainable, it
has also become significantly hard to actually act upon goals of helping the planet.
One participant said they perceive sustainability in fashion as "important" but 
"sometimes their actions don't align with their values." That is, they may
shop at stores like Target and H&M out of accessibility and convenience.
Those who do not value sustainability in their daily lives describe the 
difficulty in incorporating those practices as the primary reason why they 
have abandoned this value. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: finalPrototype,
    }}
    caption={
        "Overview of Paper Prototype"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We focused our design on two tasks: optimizing how a participant utilizes their
 closet and facilitating the exchange of secondhand clothes. Our iterative design
  process began by creating an initial paper prototype of our application.
   Then we ran two heuristic evaluations on it, identifying and resolving
    violations. Next, we conducted three usability tests. Our participants
     were college students with varying degrees of familiarity with self-tracking
      applications. Two of our participants had experience thrifting and
       valued sustainability in fashion. We began each test by giving a summary
        of our project and our design and explaining our two tasks. Then we had
         users attempt to complete both tasks with the prototype. From these
          usability tests, we identified multiple issues with our design and workflows,
           which are discussed below.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Added Workflow to Exchange a Specific Piece of Clothing

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: protoGive,
    }}
    caption={
        "New pre-post page for exchange workflow"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

This insight emerged during our first usability test when the participant clicked
 the “exchange” button on a specific item and we had no screen to show other than
  the “give” view of the exchange page. To address this, we added a “pre-post”
   window where the participant can add additional information about an item before
    posting it on the app, such as a title, description, price, tags, and images.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Further Integrated User Statistics

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: protoProfile
        },
        {
            src: protoItem,
        },
        {
            src: protoStats,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "The profile, closet, and item views are now better integrated with statistics"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

This insight also emerged during our first usability test after the participant
had completed both design tasks. They had previous experience with self-tracking
apps and wished that statistics related to themselves and their closet use
were easier to locate. To address this, we integrated user statistics more
throughout the application. On the profile page we added a graph that displays
the user's closest usage over time in addition to a button that navigates
to the “stats” view of the closet page. When a user selects an item in their
closet, there is now a button on that page that takes them to a detailed
view of that item's statistics. There is also a button that navigates to
an item's statistics when the user selects a piece on the home page.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Modified Button Descriptions to Add Clarity

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: protoHomePage,
        },
        {
            src: protoAddToOutfit,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "The home page's check button says \"Wear It!\" while the item\'s says \"Add to Outfit\""
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

This insight emerged during our third usability test when the participant was
 unclear on how to confirm the wear of an outfit for the day. They thought that,
  by adding a piece of clothing to the daily outfit, they were confirming the
   wear of that piece. To address this we changed the description of the check
    mark under a specific item of clothing to “Add to outfit” instead of “Wear it!”,
     and the description of the check mark on the home page to “Wear it!”.
      That way, it’s clear that the check mark buttons do different things.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

## Resulting Design

Our resulting design for Green Closet consists of the scanner and an
application. The scanner makes outfit tracking intuitive alongside the physical 
act of taking items out of your closet and simplifies the process of uploading
images for second-hand exchange. With the application, sustainable outfit 
planning is accomplished by the algorithm suggesting outfits according to 
personal style and usage statistics, encouraging participants to use their
closets to the fullest. The participant can also use their statistics to 
identify their least-worn clothes and upload them to our second-hand
exchange platform.  

### Task 1: Identifying Personal Style and How You Use Your Clothes

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageHomePage,
    }}
    caption={
        "Homepage, clicking shuffle, and clicking on an item in the outfit"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The homepage recommends an outfit based on personal style self-tracking data,
weather, and activities. Clicking the shuffle button generates a new 
recommended outfit. Clicking on an item in the outfit provides quick stats and 
options to browse the closet to replace that item, view detailed statistics for
that item, or shuffle only that item in the outfit.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageClosetPages,
    }}
    caption={
        "Clothes tab: View full digitized closet. Outfits tab: View closet sorted by outfits and personal style. Stats tab: View clothes and outfits sorted by usage statistics."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Clicking on Browse from the previous screen takes us to the closet, where the 
participant can replace any items in their outfit. They can also view their
closet sorted by outfits/personal style or by statistics (most or least worn 
items/outfits).


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageIndividualStats,
    }}
    caption={
        "Detailed statistics for each item of clothing"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Clicking on the Detailed Stats button gives us the leftmost page, from where
the participant can view graphical representations of how often they've worn 
that item, outfit tags, options to add the item to their Give profile, or options
to add it to their outfit for the day. Upon pressing Add to Outfit, the item
is added to the outfit on the homepage.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageConfirm,
    }}
    caption={
        "Confirming the outfit of the day"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

When the participant clicks Wear It!, a pop-up confirms that they want to select
the outfit on the homepage for the day, which helps the algorithm track clothing
usage. When the participant confirms the outfit, their closet usage statistic
updates to show them their sustainability progress. 


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Task 2: Facilitating the Exchange of Second-hand Clothing

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageExchange1,
    }}
    caption={
        "Homepage and Exchange Get and Give pages"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The participant can navigate to the Exchange page, where they can view clothes
they can get from other people or upload clothes to give (encouraging the reuse 
of clothing rather than throwing away).


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageExchange2,
    }}
    caption={
        "Adding an item to give away"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

To give away an item, press the Plus button on the Give page and follow 
the prompts on the app to scan items using the scanner. 

</ProjectImageBlock>
<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageExchange3,
    }}
    caption={
        "Creating a post"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After scanning the items, the participant can add more details to their post
and then upload it to their Give page. 


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageExchange4,
    }}
    caption={
        "Coordinate exchanges"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

To coordinate exchanges, the participant can navigate to their Inbox and message
others.
