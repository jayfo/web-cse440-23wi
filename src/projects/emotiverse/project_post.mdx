Music has been used for centuries by ancient cultures to improve well-being and
happiness. Research has shown that listening to music has significant health
benefits by reducing anxiety, which can lower the risk of various health problems
such as depression. University students often confront high levels of stress and
anxiety from academic pressures and personal experiences, which adversely affect
their mental and physical health. Despite the awareness of these negative emotions,
they often struggle to find healthy coping mechanisms to manage and alleviate these
unwanted feelings.

To address this issue, we offer a unique approach that includes
music, social interaction, and mood tracking within a metaverse. Our mood tracking
system helps users identify and reflect on their emotions, while simultaneously
use to generate personalized playlists to improve or maintain their emotions.
Additional features, like avatar customization and engaging with other users,
create an extraordinary experience that will further help regulate emotions and
increase productivity among college students.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: initialDesign,

    caption={
        "Our initial sketches of " +
        "a metaverse-like mobile application and " +
        "a remote controlled Bluetooth display speaker."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

The goal of our design research aimed to understand how people engage with music
and their experience with existing music applications. We conducted semi-structured
interviews with four college students who interact with existing music applications
regularly. This method allowed us to gather data on their music listening habits,
preferences, and experiences. Additionally, we conducted secondary research to
better understand the current market and its existing applications. Our goal was
to gather insights and find commonalities among functions the participants find
useful or need improvements. Then, use these commonalities to help us design a
new application that combines music and mood that better meets our audiences needs
and desires.

### Immersive Design to Improve Concentration

The insight emerged from a synthesis of our partcipants habits and preferences,
combined with what we found in secondary research. From the interviews, we discovered
many common habits and preferences when listening to music, such as they tend to
listen to music when they want to be productive or to feel relaxed. However, for
some participants, music with lyrics and phone notifications can be distracting.
This insight shows that current music streaming apps often don't make recommendations
based on the listeners current needs nor provide environments to maximize the effect
of music. To address this, we aim to design a music app that creates an immersive
environment where it will help listeners maintain their focus and productivity.
We plan to achieve this by recommending various types of personalized playlists
based on the listeners goal, such as upbeat music to maintain a cheerful mood or
non-lyrical music or white noise to create a conducive environment for concentration.
To further enhance the immersive experience, we plan to design a Bluetooth speaker
that will display various types of animations to help reduce possible distractions.

### Simplifying Music Sharing

This insight emerged from user feedback and secondary research on social interaction
and music discovery. We found that our participants like to share music but existing
app features for sharing are cumbersome. For example, the sync share feature, which
allows users to listen to music together, is not widely used due to the complexity
of setting it up and learning how to use it. We aim to simplify sharing with an
intuitive, user-friendly feature that encourages social interaction and music discovery.

### Personalization and Recommendation


The insight came from user feedback and secondary research on the importance of
personalization and recommendation in music applications. Our interviews revealed
that participants create playlists for various moods and occasions. They discover
new music mainly through app recommendations and friends suggestions. This insight
shows the importance of well designed personalization and recommendation features
of a music app. Our music app prioritizes these features, allowing users to create
personalized playlists, and receive recommendations based on their mood, music
history, and preferences.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

Our iterative design process focused on getting our idea out on paper through
the paper prototype and making the application easy to use through many inspections
and usability tests. We began our design process by paper prototyping to quickly
explore ideas and gather feedback from users. Next, we conducted heuristic evaluation
and usability testing on our paper prototypes to identify any usability issues to
overall improve our design. With the feedback we received, we iterated upon our
design and created a digital mockup using Figma. Our design focused on two main
tasks: improve productivity through music and study with friends and improve mood
through daily tracking.

### Addressing User Confusion

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: AddressUserConfusion,
    }}
    caption={
        "Addressing the confusion of accessing the recommended playlist"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our heuristics evaluation and usability testing revealed participants confusions
about the location of the generated playlist based on their mood, as it was originally
placed on the mood tracking screen instead of the music screen where many participants
expected it to be. Due to this placement, many participants were confused as to
what the playlist was at all. To resolve this, the playlist was moved to the music
screen and a shortcut was added to access this generated playlist through the
homepage via a button. Furthermore, a participant pointed out that swiping left
and right was inconvenient to find a specific playlist, especially if they have
a lot of different playlists. As a result, the screen layout was redesigned to
improve accessibility. The buttons within our entire app are also labeled for clarity.

### Enhancing User Control and Flexibility

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: RewardsSystem,
    }}
    caption={
        "The process of connecting to speaker."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In our usability testing, the feedback revealed users wanted more control and
flexibility with the process of entering speaker and study mode. Our original
design combined the connecting process of both the speaker and study mode to be
within the same screen, which restricted the useability for participants who
wanted to only connect to the speaker or study mode and not both. To improve
this, we separated the process of connecting to the speaker and study mode into
different screens, while adding shortcuts to the other within each screen.
For example, adding the option to connect to the speaker within study mode.
This also allowed us to add shortcuts on the home screen for an easier process
of connecting to the speaker or enter study mode. Another problem found by our
participants was regarding the process of connecting to the speaker. Initially,
we designed this process to give the user the flexibility of selecting a different
background and animation for the character every time. However, from the feedback
we received, this process can be troublesome and become a distraction. To address
this issue, we give the option for the user to set a default background and animation
on the setting page and remove the prompt to customize the speaker display when connecting.
This insight enhanced user control and flexibility, while providing a more seamless user experience.

### Adding a Rewards System

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: UserContFlex,
    }}
    caption={
        "Incentives that can be used for customization"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our final key insight highlighted the importance of incentives. Usability testing
and class critique feedback revealed adding a rewards system can motivate the users
to continue using our application. To address this issue, we added a currency-based
rewards system for inputting mood or studying for a set amount of period. Users
can spend this currency to buy customization for their avatars and rooms, such as
hairstyles, clothes, furniture, and more. This addition improved engagement and
made the application more enjoyable to use.

    caption={
        "The key features of Emotiverse."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

### Overall Design
Emotiverse is primarily a music and social network mobile application with
inspirations from the Metaverse. The incorporation of a Bluetooth speaker
provides a way for our users to relax and enjoy music or focus on important tasks,
distraction-free. The display of the speaker is designed to help create a more
immersive environment when using our mobile applications. Our goal for Emotiverse
is to provide a solution for university students to become more conscious of
their emotions and help manage them through features such as personalized music,
mood tracker, and various ways of interacting with other users.
