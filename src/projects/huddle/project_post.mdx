## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *   - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *     Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

It's late at night. After a long solo walk from campus, you are finally getting 
home from your group meeting. Approaching your apartment, you realize your 
neighbor is also getting back from studying and is unlocking the main
door just ahead of you. As you walk up the stairs together, you find out that 
they were in the same building working two floors down from your favorite study spot.

This situation has happened to most of us in one form or another. Both students 
and safety professionals have noted that travelling in groups is far preferred 
over commuting alone. Living in the city, students are put at risk every time a 
class or project meeting gets out late and no one else from the group is headed 
in the same direction. What if we extended that circle?  We realized that, as 
students, there is almost always someone we know nearby. However, it is difficult 
to connect when even a 30 second difference in departure time can destroy the
possibility of overlapping paths.

To solve this problem, Huddle connects people who already know each other before 
leaving for their destination. By collecting data about people's commutes, 
we can broadcast the data to other people they already trust, thus
maximizing the opportunity to have a partner for even part of a commute.

Safety goes beyond companionship, however. We realized that we can't change 
the relative safety of an area, but we are able to alter how students react to it. 
This is where the second component of our design comes in. Whether walking
alone or in a huddle, app users also have access to our Safer Route mapping. 
This feature combines real-time safety updates with general safety trends as 
reported by other users. It provides an extra level of awareness for anyone 
trying to get around campus, independent of others' availability.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

For our design research process, we wanted to find UW students who were living on 
or around the U District area to see if they happened to experience any instances 
whilst commuting in which they felt unsafe. While researching our topic, we found 
that 82% of American college students are concerned about their safety, so we 
wanted to get real feedback from UW students to see if there was anything that 
they wished could be improved about their commuting experience. We chose to 
conduct semi-structured interviews because we had specific questions we wanted to 
ask, but wanted to have flexibility in the conversation based on the students' 
responses. We interviewed 3 computer science students: a sophomore who takes the 
lightrail, a junior who usually walks home, and sophomore who busses. We selected 
these students because they had been commuting around Seattle for at least a year 
and would be our target audience for improving their commuting experience.

### Seeing the Same People on the Way Home but Not Approaching Them

When asked if they saw familiar faces in their daily commutes, our participants 
explained that they would see the same people on the bus or while walking from 
home to class everyday, but were timid or uncomfortable with the idea of just 
walking up and approaching them. One participant said that he wished there was 
a way for him to talk to those people. Another participant mentioned the 
recognition of those familiar faces being friends of their friends who they 
knew lived in the same place as them.

### Want to Stay Connected to Others, but Need to Be Aware of Surroundings

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: friendsImage,
            caption: "At night, when someone doesn't want to walk home alone, " +
                     "they can go on their phone to find a friend.",
        },
        {
            src: busImage,
            caption: "We wanted to make bussing less intimidating with live " +
                     "alerts and suggested things to do inbetween waiting.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

Our participants stated that they wanted to keep talking with their friends
while they were commuting, but found it difficult because they also had to 
be extra aware of what was going on around them. One participant said that 
she commonly uses FaceTime to call her friends on her commute, while 
another says that she doesn't because "when my phone is on speaker, I don’t 
like people hearing my conversations and I don’t want to put earbuds in 
cause I want to be aware of my surroundings.” Our last participant said, "I 
usually double check to make sure no one’s following me and stuff,” 
gesturing that he looks over his shoulder frequently. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Waiting for the Bus Can Be Scary, Unreliable, and Time-Consuming

All of our participants mentioned that they had used the bus before to commute 
to a destination. One of our participants says that “Waiting at the bus stop 
by myself can be scary.” Another says that while bussing may be safer, she 
often opts to walk because of how unreliable the buses can be.
As a result of these findings, we wanted to add a feature to our design that 
allowed for timely alerts of any events that would affect someone's route and, 
as a result, update the route to reflect any changes from the alerts.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: paperOverview,
    }}
    caption={
        "The final iteration of our paper prototype."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We started off by creating our paper prototype. Since we had two tasks
we wanted to focus on, we made sure that the functionalities of our
app were targeted towards helping participants accomplish these goals. 
Our first task was having individuals find a huddle (person or group) 
to commute with. Our second task was having individuals find a safe route 
home. After this, we conducted heuristic evaluations to better 
understand how different participants would interact with our prototype.  
Participants executed the previously mentioned tasks while evaluating 
our designs during our usability tests as well. We asked two evaluators 
in our CSE 440 class to go through our prototype and they helped us 
identify usability problems in our design. We were able to gather 
helpful feedback surrounding Nielsen’s Heuristics. Following the 
heuristic evaluation, we did usability testing. We asked three different 
students if they would be willing to participate in our test. First we 
talked to a freshman in the Nanoscience Building who generally walked to 
all of his classes and did not spend too much time on West campus. Our 
second participant was a senior in our CSE 440 section who usually walked 
to campus. Lastly, we talked to a sophomore at the Odegaard Library who 
usually took the bus and walked if she was running late. We were able to 
get very helpful feedback that allowed us to refine our prototype in 
several ways. We proceeded to complete our digital mockup by using what 
we learned from all our past evaluations and reflections as a team 
using the Figma platform.

### Providing an Initial Tutorial 

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: insight1
    }}
    caption={
        "Initial design without tutorial on the left and refined design with home screen tutorial on the right."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Initially our main home page had three main functionality buttons 
but while conducting our usability test with the senior in our 
CSE 440 section, she mentioned how she was not sure what the buttons 
were supposed to do. Since we had to serve as “human computers” 
we were not able to guide her. However, this shed light upon the 
fact that we should make sure to include a clear tutorial that 
participants are able to see upon entry onto the main page instead 
of seeing just the buttons. We added a detailed description bubble 
for what each button did so that participants could clearly choose 
one, depending on the task they wanted to accomplish.  

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Adding Proximity Clarity on Finding a Huddle

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: insight2,
    }}
    caption={
        "Initial design without adjustable radius on the left and adjustable radius for finding friends to commute with on the right."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During our usability test with the sophomore from the Odegaard library, 
she asked us how close her friends were to her when choosing who to 
add to her huddle. We could not clarify this during the process 
since we were practicing an “off-hands” practice but it got us 
thinking about how we should solve this challenge. She brought up a 
valid point because with our prototype at the time, there was no 
way of knowing how close or far your friends were from you. We 
decided to add an adjustable radius for people to find other contacts 
that were close to them to commute with. This added more clarity to 
the process of picking individuals to commute with.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Allowing Modification of Huddle Requests

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: insight3,
    }}
    caption={
        "​​Initial request design on the top. Iterated screens with more flexibility when sending requests at the bottom."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

While going through our prototype as a group, we observed that 
there was no way to modify the request that individuals would 
send others to create a huddle. At first, our model was very 
rigid and individuals who received the request could only 
accept or decline. This seemed very inflexible so we modified 
our request page by making it more open-ended to accommodate 
more situations. We made it a text box where we prompted them 
with some questions that they could use to send their request. 
We also added more cancel button and back button scenarios to 
give the participant more flexibility when creating a request.

## Resulting Design

### Signing Up

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: home,
        },
        {
            src: signUp,
        },
        {
            src: login,
        },
        {
            src: tutorial,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

To get started, students can create an account and use UW single sign-on to verify 
that they are a UW student. There is also an option to toggle accessible routing 
if a user needs it. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### User Onboarding

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: tutorialSequence,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Tutorial sequence"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once signed up, the app executes a tutorial of the home screen. The home (huddle) 
screen displays where the user can input their next commute, a section showing the 
current huddle, any huddle requests they have received, and a section for messages.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Adding Friends

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: profile,
        },
        {
            src: friends,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In the profile screen, a user can change their settings such as who they allow 
friend requests from. "Contacts only" allows people that are already in the 
user's saved phone contacts to be added as friends on the app, while "contacts 
and friends of existing friends" allows a user to also add people their friends 
have in their friends list. Consequently, in the Friends screen, the user can 
view their friends, people they can add from their contacts (and people their 
friends have added if they chose this setting), and any incoming friend requests. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Task 1: Build a Huddle to Commute With Friends

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: huddle,
        },
        {
            src: updateStatus,
        },
        {
            src: updatedStatus,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

A user can input their commute status, which will allow their status to be seen 
by friends. Commute status includes where they're starting their route, where 
they're headed, and around what time they'd like to make the commute.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: sendRequest,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

A request for a huddle can be sent through "Find a Huddle". A user can select 
a friend they'd like to commute with and send them a request based on time and 
location to meet up. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: receiveRequest,
        },
        {
            src: acceptedRequest,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After a request is sent, the friend will get a notification that will appear 
in the huddle requests section. Once accepted, the huddle will show up in the 
"active huddles" section for both parties. Messages will also display further 
communication leaving it open for any changes.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Task 2: Finding a Safe Route

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: routes,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

A user can start looking for a commute route after inputting their start and 
end locations. Our app will display route options and recommend a route based 
on safety from post-route safety data from users and route information. At the 
end of the commute, users can submit ratings for the route.

</ProjectImagesBlock>
