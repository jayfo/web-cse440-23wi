Conflict is an inevitable element of interpersonal relationships, and unhealthy handling often 
produces harmful and unwanted behaviors. Many conflicts are brushed aside, and resolved only at a 
surface level, leading to recurring and worsening conflicts. Conflict is often something that requires time 
and sustained effort to settle, and without proper management and self-awareness meaningful 
resolution is hard to achieve.  


Maintaining a healthy relationship in spite of these conflicts requires both parties being mindful 
of their own feelings as well as their counterpart’s feelings. Wishbone conducts meaningful resolution by 
providing a mobile application interface that facilitates a blend of personal and cooperative reflection 
through guided writing prompts, ultimately leading both parties to identify and agree upon action points 
that effectively address the needs of the other. A recorded history log allows individuals to remember 
and reflect upon their previous conflicts and action points, encouraging continued steps towards true 
resolution.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

Understanding is the first key step in building a viable and focused design solution for any problem. To 
that effect, we had these goals in mind while conducting the relevant research: understanding the 
contexts in which conflicts arise and understanding the ways different people tackle conflict. From those 
goals, we also had some subgoals of identifying common patterns between our participants and gauging 
reception towards technology-assisted solutions.

We sought participants who could provide insight and allow us to achieve the above goals. So, we 
conducted interviews with four participants across different age groups, profession, and relationship 
statuses: a couples counselor, a Doctorate student, and two undergraduate students. We chose 
interviews in order to collect qualitative data in a space where the interviewee can feel empowered to 
share as much or as little as they like and can talk about their conflict experiences in a setting temporally 
and spatially removed.

### Communication and Acknowledgement of Feelings is Vital

Communication surfaced as a common theme among our three non-professional participants; 
they all discussed that some form of communication is vital to how they approach and deal with 
conflict. Our Doctorate-pursuing participant remarked that they would communicate to their 
partner when they are in a heated situation, “I really need some space. Can you give me some 
space for a bit?” Another one of our participants said that regardless of how much the truth of 
the conflict hurts, they would always go for a face-to-face meeting to talk things out. Our last 
non-professional participant talked about how any communication is better than no 
communication. Following from this, communication became a key aspect of our solution, which 
our initial storyboard demonstrates.

### Self Awareness is the First Step to Healthy Conflict Management

Our professional interviewee, Mark (a pseudonym), remarked how root emotions that are the source of 
the conflict  are often not shared, understood, or acknowledged by either party; we could clearly see 
how in the conflict experiences of our other participants self awareness comes into play, asking 
questions like “Why did I even get mad in the first place?” or realizing that their own pride is what drove 
the conflict. Realizing these underlying emotions paves the way for more options and possibilities in 
relationships, as well as inviting the other party into your life in mutually satisfying ways, says Mark. To 
reflect this idea, our design ideas from the beginning were focused on self-identifying emotions and 
exploring why one felt that way. Here is one of our first designs that focused heavily on self awareness:

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: commAwareness,
            caption: "Communication and self awareness in our chosen design's storyboard",
        },
        {
            src: designTwo,
            caption: "Written reflection in sketch for one of our initial design ideas",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Time for Processing is Needed

Our third key insight to managing conflict healthily was that time helps…a lot. Again, this was a 
sentiment shared by all our participants in which taking time away from the other party and 
physically distancing helped as it gave time for people to think and process if needed (instead of 
rushing into things). The digital mockup of our final design has a section where we incorporated 
that same sense of space and time in a manner that fit the solution we came up with; this took 
the form of a “breather” screen between one’s own reflection and reading the other party’s 
reflection.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

We constructed our design to support the completion of these two tasks: 1. Articulating Feelings 
and Receiving Validation 2. Remembering Action Points and Takeaways. With these tasks in 
mind, our first step was creating a paper prototype which provided the foundation and 
framework for the functionality of our design. This paper prototype was then deployed through 
a series of tests that included 2 heuristic evaluations, and 3 usability tests. These tests helped us 
identify a series of issues that led us to iteratively revising our paper prototype into a final 
version that we were confident meaningfully and functionally supported our tasks. We finally 
transitioned the framework of our final paper prototype into a digital mockup where we 
incorporated design elements to complement the prototype’s functionality.

### Incorporating Consistency Between Interactive Components

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeConsistency,
            caption: "Before consistency change to \"next\" button",
        },
        {
            src: afterConsistency,
            caption: "After consistency change to \"next\" button",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
Our initial paper prototype was created with the primary focus being to support the two tasks that we 
had outlined. In order to navigate around our interface, we created icons for buttons that did not always 
follow the same structure or aesthetic. Thus, during our first heuristic evaluation our inspector noted 
confusion regarding the functionality of certain buttons icons. The lack of consistency from screen to 
screen of the appearance of buttons that should have the same functionality caused unnecessary work 
for our inspectors to guess what each button will do. This led us to be mindful in all future iterations of 
our prototypes and design to maintain internal consistency among all of our interactive icons. One key 
example of this change is documented below with the simplification and standardization of our “next” 
button that takes the individual to the next screen in the task.

### Ensuring Intuitive Core Functionality

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeFunctionality,
            caption: "Before functionality change to navigation",
        },
        {
            src: afterFunctionality,
            caption: "After functionality change to navigation",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

While providing functionality for completing our tasks was at the forefront of our goals with creating our 
initial paper prototype, there were many key components missing that disallowed for an individual to 
smoothly complete our tasks. These issues were by far our most severe and important aspects that we 
aimed to revise. They were brought to light through our usability tests, where there would be incidents 
in which our participants found themselves stuck on a screen in our prototype where they were unable 
to proceed. This indicated to us to ensure each portion of our design has a clear way of advancing and 
escaping the current screen. For all future iterations of our design, we incorporated this functionality, 
with a key example of this revision shown to the right.

### Removing Assumptions

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeAssumption,
            caption: "Before assumption change",
        },
        {
            src: afterAssumption,
            caption: "After assumption change",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
When designing our initial paper prototype, one critical mistake that we made was making improper 
assumptions about the individuals who would be using our design. We primarily designed from the 
perspective of our own knowledge and capabilities, but failed to recognize the potential variability in 
that of our participants. During our usability testing, we encountered incidents where our participants 
were either surprised or confused about certain aspects of our design that we did not originally identify 
ourselves because we incorrectly assumed that participants would have the same understanding of how 
our interface works as we do. This led us to make revisions while being mindful to not make assumptions 
about those who will use the design. An example of this is displayed in which we assume that an 
individual would know that the “personal reflection” responses are something that will be shared, when 
in reality there is no indication for someone using the design for the first time, and this was pointed out 
to us by our participant in the usability test. An assumption that we made that revolved around 
accessibility and inclusivity was one in which we assumed audio calling capabilities of those using our 
design, and we also made revisions to have more inclusive wording and options. 
</ProjectImagesBlock>

## Resulting Design

Our resulting design from a quarter of iterating revolves around key features including individual 
processing of thoughts and emotions through personal reflection, acknowledgement of both party’s 
feelings through shared responses and co-edited situation writing, and intentional retention and 
execution of resolution through saved action points.  These elements are encompassed within the 
completion of two tasks: (1) articulating feelings and receiving validation (2) remembering action points 
and takeaways.

### Articulating Feelings and Receiving Validation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: homeScreen,
        },
        {
            src: inviteScreen,
        },
        {
            src: prHeaderScreen,
        },
        {
            src: prScreen,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Creating wishbone, inviting, and inputting personal components"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
To articulate one’s feelings, an individual can create a new wishbone from the homescreen, choose their 
contact of interest, and begin recording their emotions then their thoughts and feelings.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: otherPrScreen,
        },
        {
            src: callingScreen,
        },
        {
            src: coeditScreen,
        },
        {
            src: writeActionPointScreen,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Collaborative process of receiving other’s reflection and writing together"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once both parties have completed the personal reflection process, they can exchange their entries, 
optionally utilize another form of communication, then begin working on co-editing a collaborative 
version of the situation at hand. Once the situation has been agreed upon, individuals are prompted to 
write their own action points on what they can do to help resolve the conflict.

### Remembering Action Points & Takeaways

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: homeScreen,
        },
        {
            src: boneLogScreen,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Navigating to history log"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
To go back and remember one’s action points or revisit the previous situations
and reflections, an individual can view “past” from the homepage and view a log 
of their previously created wishbones.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: prevWishbone,
        },
        {
            src: prevActionPointScreen,
        },
        {
            src: prevSitautionScreen,
        },
        {
            src: otherActionPointScreen,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Navigating a previous Wishbone's situation & action points"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
Once selected, the individual can view the situation and both people’s reflections
and action points.
