### Problem
 
The overall problem space we explored was that the gym is can be a stressful environment for beginners who don't know how to use equipment and people often find it difficult to manage their time when they're at the gym because of busyness in different sections. Within the gym, there is an internal pressure, particularly against women and people who don't stereotypically fall into the "gym bro" stereotype. This pressure makes it difficult to work out, and often times, this pressure also leads to a hesitance to ask for help when one is struggling. People also find that machines can be super busy at different times of the day and find it difficult to stick to a schedule and remain on time. As a result, this leads to people not pushing themselves as hard, not asking for help, and sometimes even skip their gym workout altogether. This results in people seeing the gym environment as a burden rather than a routine.

### Design
 
Hence, we designed a new app to combat the issue of hostile gym environments and gym hesitancy. We are proposing a gym app that would help to combat this issue. This gym app would be an app that would be specially catered to each gym, and it would include a map of the gym that would help to guide the users, and guide them around the gym most effectively. The app would have two primary functionalities. One of these functionalities was knowing how crowded the gym is before going while measuring the business of specific machines. The other functionality was understanding the various muscle groups and fitness areas that a machine primarily targets and guiding the user through the process of using the machines effectively to avoid injury.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

Phase 1: Brainstorming

Given that we had multiple ideas that we wanted to sort through and research on, we wanted to explore the problem space to see if there were any immediate issues that we could address. Going in, team members identified three different problems each that they thought were big problems they faced in their day to day lives. Then, the problem space was narrowed down to three pressing issues decided by the team through examining problem spaces and comparing the relevance of the issues. The team narrowed the problem selections down to the following three problems:
* Auto Pet Feeder
* Virtual Personal Trainer
* Budget Tracker

While these ideas were vague, and not quite fleshed out, it is important to note that these problems have not had a definitive solution created that addressed all our requirements, but we knew that the solution would have something to do with tracking as that was the selected theme for the course. After a discussion period, the team eventually decided to move forth with the virtual personal trainer, after recognizing how much difficulty we, as beginners, faced with sticking to a gym routine and learning the uses of different gym equipment. 

Phase 2: Design Research

Next,  we conducted research to identify the issues that were in our problem space. To do this, we determined the audience that we would target and the people who would use our design. In order to do this, we would first analyze the fitness trends and datasets to frame our interview questions around. We also made sure to target a carefully selected interview sample space to receive the best results for the group that we were trying to target. The next step was to write down a few starter questions that would guide the research. These questions were separated into two subgroups in order to satisfy our target audiences: beginner and experienced gym members. This would differentiate our two interest groups and help us better understand the issues that the interviewees had based on their experience level. We ended up choosing participants from the CSE Powerlifters group, Elm Gym, the IMA, and other close family and friends. We aimed to get people from a broad range of experience levels. Our primary research method for this project was through interviews and we aimed to get a diverse range of interviewees depending on level of gym experience, as well as an even split between male and female identifying participants to see if there was a divide in perspectives related to what stops people from going to the gym based on the gender they present as. We interviewed male members of CSE Powerlifters, an experienced weightlifting group on campus, as well as female members of the IMA who take beginner workout classes there. Another research method we used was meta analysis of data collected through previous research studies that helped us identify key factors that stop people from regularly going to the gym.



### Long Wait Times and Time Management

We found that more experienced gym members largely had the most difficulty dealing with long wait times, especially when running on busy schedules. It's often difficult to determine how busy the gym is going to be or different equipment is going to be before heading to the gym, and it's not something they can really anticipate. Our participants found that they often lost motivation to go to the gym in parts of the year where the gym was regularly busy and it was hard to occupy themselves with something else during waiting time. One participant in particular from the CSE Powerlifters group dealt with an issue where they had a very heavy courseload for winter quarter, but because of how busy the gym tends to get at the beginning of the year, they found it difficult to stick to their gym routine without planned out machine alternatives. 

### Learning New Equipment and Avoiding Injury

        {

        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

People who go to the gym more casually and as beginners had more issues feeling fearful of getting injured when learning about how to use new equipment. Because of this, they didn't feel confident enough to try new machines and step out of their comfortome. For example, one of the beginner-level participants we interviewed often uses the treadmill, but wanted to try weightlifting. However, because they had difficulty understanding how to properly use the squat rack, position themselves, what weight to start with, and how to perform the exercise correctly without hurting their backs and knees, they lacked motivation to continue learning. It would be time consuming without proper aid and help.

### Intimidation and Fear of Asking for Help

A lot of participants from our beginner and intermediate level interviewee samples, particularly female-identifying ones, also faced a lot of intimidation at the gym. When learning new equipment, they felt anxiety when trying to find people to ask for help and often did not ask for help altogether out of fear. For our experienced gym-goers, they faced a similar issue often when looking for people to help spot them. In the case that a gym buddy did not come along, it was often difficult to ask for help without feeling like you were taking away someone else's time. 

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

During the testing process, we realized that it was very difficult to give the participant instructions on how to use the paper prototype without oversharing and giving away details we were already familiar with, given that it was our own design. We didn't want to give too much information because we wanted to get accurate and realistic feedback on the usability and accessibility of the prototype and all the design issues we failed to consider by over-familiarizing ourselves with our own design. For the rest of our research, we hoped to make navigation details easier to infer by modifying the design and sharing less information overall so we can get more valuable feedback.
We performed a heuristic evaluation that involved understanding Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. This process involved analyzing ten different aspects of the apps for the most concerning features. As a result, we realized that we had issues with helping to guide the user through their gym workout effectively. Additionally, the gym status and navigation weren’t correlated. Particularly the seventh heuristic dealing with flexibility and efficiency of use was the most difficult to perceive through. As a result, we installed shortcuts in order to help with the more experienced users to navigate to the location of the machine and a search feature in order to make the machine more accessible to remove the issue of manually locating the machine. Additionally, we added a “business status” so that it can be more apparent how busy certain areas of the gym are within the map. Lastly, we addressed the issue of navigating the app by adding a navigation bar to the bottom to make it easier to move around to the other places and to give it a “cell phone app” feel. Overall, the user feedback was very helpful as it gave us realistic and helpful feedback on issues that we didn’t know we had. 
After making the necessary design modifications, we did usability tests with three different users in our representative population in order to get a better feel of the issues with our app. We tested on a beginner woman, casual workout woman, and a frequent workout man. The information we were able to gather from the usability tests were that the naming conventions were confusing and that design and color-coding could’ve improved the process for users. Finally, this led to the final digital mockup, which incorporated all of the design feedback into consideration. In particular, we color coded the tasks, added icons to the bottom with text, and made the design aesthetically pleasing.


### Color Coding for Easy Interpretation

<ProjectImageBlock image={{ src: colorCodedMap, }} caption={ "Our updated color-coded map." } width={6} maxHeight={"400px"}>

The first important revision was to color code the map of the floors of the gym. When looking at the map of the gym, it used to have no way to indicate the busyness of a room in the gym. By color-coading the map of the gym, the participant can see how busy the space is before they enter. We learned this was an important feature during usability testing because one of our participants said they would not enter a room in the gym if it was too busy. In our previous design, the participant would have to walk into a room to see how busy it is. We wanted to alleviate this step of having to walk into the room by color-coding the rooms in the gym by busyness. This is important because it saves the participant time and makes going to the gym a smoother experience, which is one of the main goals of our application.

### Modifying Navigation Bar

<ProjectImageBlock image={{ src: newNavBar, }} caption={ "Our updated navigation bar." } width={6} maxHeight={"400px"}>

The second important revision we made was changing the language in the navigation bar. In our previous design, we had the home screen labeled as Gym Status. We learned this language by completing the task of, “seeing how busy a machine is,” confusing for participants. Rather than going to the map, one of the participants in our usability test went to the “Gym Status” screen to find the busyness of a machine. We are going to combat this confusion by making the home screen titled, “Home.” This is important because it will allow participants to clearly achieve the task of, “seeing how busy a machine is,” without confusion.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Promoting Inclusivity

One revision we made to promote the inclusivity of people at various knowledge levels about the gym and their personal anatomy was the revision related to popping up an image showing muscle groups that are targeted instead of just listing them. Oftentimes, people who are attempting to gain more familiarity with muscle groups targeted by different machines might not be able to identify specific muscle groups by just their name, so having a diagram there to aid them in their learning process is essential. We had made an unintentional assumption that the people using our app would already be familiar with where specific muscle groups are located if they wanted to use a specific machine that they believed might target those muscles. 
Another revision we made related to meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines was increasing the font size of the machine status because it was too small beforehand. WCAG guidelines advise bigger text to ensure that text is not illegible. Conceptually, our design process so far has been targeted towards promoting inclusive environments at the gym so we didn't have to make many modifications about the overall design process. Some assumptions we made were related to visibility of colors to indicate the busyness of gym sections. We used green, red and yellow but the green-red spectrum is difficult for people who are colorblind to differentiate. In future iterations, we hope to create more distinct and contrasting color options and also turn a lot of the more wordy sections into separate sections using buttons so text-to-speech applications don’t have to read aloud everything all at once.

## Resulting Design

In implementing the digital mockup, we made a few different design decisions depending on inconsistencies we found in the paper prototype and more realistic options that should be available to users. We formatted the gym map to no longer be diagonal across the page because a horizontal layout is generally more familiar to people using maps for reference. We decided to keep the information on the machine info page fairly minimal and instead of buttons leading up to pages with more detailed information. For example, we have Status Information, Path to the machine, and Equipment User Information for video tutorials and targeted muscles. We added more information to our map legend to indicate the meaning of different colors related to section busyness. We also made the map section more minimal in terms of determining if a machine was open or not, based on the color of the machine, than having two background indicators as seen in the paper prototype. Lastly, we noticed in that there was missing functionality in terms of navigating in-between pages, such as traversing the map if there were multiple floors and added buttons to reduce navigation time to important pages that could complete the task quicker for the user, such as, “My Workouts” in the overall map page in addition to having it in the machine map page as well.

Walkthrough: Participants can see the busyness of the rooms at the gym. Then they can click a room to see the busyness of each machine, once they click a machine, they can see the status of it clearly marked above the image of the machine. In addition, participants could alternatively diverge from the map path to complete the task and click the My Workouts button to show the participant’s workouts and their status for that exercise and machine that is involved.
