## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *   - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *     Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

The ages of 2-7 are a crucial stage of development for children. During this age range, a child
needs to receive a balanced diet as what they consume will ultimately affect their health and growth.
Additionally, it is also during the ages of 2-7 where a child’s diet requirement undergoes many changes,
so it is important for caretakers to adapt to these changes. As such, caretakers should be able to
 effectively track their child’s diet. However, there are not many effective solutions offered currently
 and the solutions that offer diet tracking are not targeted towards children.

Our solution is The Kiddie Table which is a smart table that simplifies meal tracking and planning
for caretakers. By providing insightful analytics about a child’s nutritional information over time
and utilizing an organized calendar system, caretakers can track and plan a child’s meal with very
little hassle. Kids can interact with the table too through the use of avatars, customizations,
and a rewards system. While interacting with the table, kids grow to develop healthy relationships
with food in a fun yet educational way.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

For our design research, it was imperative to get the perspective
of others who have more experience with children. The target audience of this project
are caretakers. We also sought to hear from medical professionals to
understand the physical and psychological milestones that children reach between the ages
of 2 and 7 years. For the caretakers, we interviewed a first time father of a 18-month-old,
a first time mother of a 9-month-old and the mother of 4 children aged 0-6 years. Among the
healthcare professionals, we interviewed a pediatrician and a gynecologist to gain more insight
into our problem statement.

### Most caretakers track their children's diets mentally

During our research study, we learned that caretakers tend to not formally track their children's diet.
This was true for both first time parents and parents of multiple children. Mental tracking does not
facilitate sharing the meal tracking and planning with other caretakers. This can become particularly
challenging when a caretaker cares for multiple children because children tend to trade their food.
It can also be challenging when there are pets in the household because children would sometimes
feed their food to the family's pet.


### Children are really good at intuitive eating

        }

Parents encouraged their children to explore their food options instead of restricting them
to a single food and forcing them to eat it. This helped the children develop a healthy
relationship with food.

### Reliance on friends and doctors

The first time parents we interviewed did not have much experience with children prior
to their first child. They relied on the advice of family, friends and doctors in many
aspects of their child's life including feeding. This suggests that a social aspect to feeding children is very important.


## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

After our research, we determined the two tasks that we wanted to center our design on were
tracking meals of a child and developing healthy eating.

We developed our initial paper prototype, and conducted two usability tests to better help us
understand the strengths and weaknesses of our design. From those usability tests, we learned that
our design was not very appealing to children, and the language being used was confusing for our
participants (e.g. the use of the words “add to log” vs “add to plan”).

For our final design, we incorporated feedback received from our usability tests and made changes
to our design accordingly.  We changed the design of buttons across the design and changed the
language to something more clear and intuitive for our participants. In addition to that, we
introduced a gamified design that would allow children to help their parents track meals in a fun
and interactive way by feeding customizable avatar and gaining points.

It was because of these changes that our original tasks were intertwined. The tracking of the meals
with our design would as a result fulfill the developing healthy eating task. We finally defined
the following tasks for our project:
* Tracking the meals of a child
* Planning the meals of a child


### Positive Engagement

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageHome,
    }}
    caption={
        "This is a image of our Home page."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

While we were working on our design, we were focusing a lot on what the parent was going to be able to do with their child and kind of wandered away from the idea of child engagement. We had users asking what aspects of the design would be accessible to a child. We wanted to make sure that there were positive interactions between the different components of the table and the younger users as well. We worked toward thinking more about components that would excite a child and give them a positive outlook on healthy eating habits and what moderation can be. We took the general idea of making the table more interactive with the child by giving them customizable avatars that as the day goes on, the kid can feed their avatar.

### Clearer Language

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageLogging,
    }}
    caption={
        "This is an image of how the logging of meals is done."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our design initially used the word log for all days past, present and future. This was confusing to the participants of our usability tests since log refers to the past while plan refers to the future. Using one term over the other would still be confusing. Instead, we now log for past days and plan for future days.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Overview Page

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageOverview,
    }}
    caption={
        "This is an image of our Overview page."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our overview page is something that we focused a lot of our energy on. We were looking into the different ways of being able to present the processed data and ensuring that when a user wants to look at the overview, they have a nice way of viewing the processed information. We wanted to emphasize the greater food groups that have the most impact on health.

## Resulting Design

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: task1,
    }}
    caption={
        "Task 1: Tracking the meals of a child."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Task 1: Tracking the meals of a child

In this interaction, the child records that they ate a watermelon today and drags a watermelon over into the avatar's mouth. By doing this, the Kiddie Table will track that a watermelon was consumed by the child today.


</ProjectImageBlock>

Task 2: Planning the meals of a child
The action of editing a future days’ plan is shown here. We select the day we want to plan for. Then we select the meal we want to add to. Finally, we type in what we plan to eat and click “submit plan”. In this example,  Wednesday, Feb 16th is considered a day in the future.
